Quick Check 1

1. Describe the three types of program errors.
Load-time or syntax errors in which the interpreter finds error in the syntax of the code as it initially loads it.

Runtime errors in which the interpret has loaded the code but is unable to run it due to such factors as an unreferenced variable or a mistyped function name.

Logic errors in which the program can be interpreted and run but has an incorrect result due to a flaw in the programâ€™s logic.
2. What is the error in the following code and what type of error is it? document.writ("Hello World");
The error is a syntax error in which document.writ should have been document.write.

3. What is the error in the following code and what type of error is it?
let firstValue = 10;
let secondValue = 20;
let result = firstvalue + secondValue;
This is a runtime error in which the error occurs because the firstValue variable is written as firstvalue in the final statement of the code.

4. If the browser console reports a single syntax error, does that mean there is only one syntax error in the code?
No. The debugger will stop at the first instance of a syntax errors. There may be others in the code that have not been reached yet.


Quick Check 2

1. The orderCost variable in a long and elaborate program might be incorrectly calculated. Provide code to display the value of the variable within an alert box.

2. Provide code to write the value of orderCost to the console log.

3. What are three reasons to use the console log approach over the alert box approach?

4. Why would you comment out sections of a program that is producing errors?
