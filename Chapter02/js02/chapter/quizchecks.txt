1. What is the difference between a named function and an anonymous function?
A named function has a specific name and can be reused or called by that name.
An anonymous function does not have a name and is often used where functions 
are passed as arguments or assigned to variables and used in one time situations
like event listeners.



2. What is a command block?
A command block is a group of code statements enclosed in curly braces {}, used to 
define a block of code for functions, loops, or conditionals.



3. Provide an expression to call the findSqr() function using 10 as the parameter value.
findSqr(10);



4. What is the difference between the capture phase and the bubbling phase for an event occurring within a website?
In the capture phase, the event is handled starting from the outermost element (like the document or window) and moves 
down to the target element.
In the bubbling phase, the event starts at the target element and bubbles up through its parent elements.



5. An HTML file contains the following tag:
<input type="button" value="Submit" id="SubmitButton" />

Provide the code to run the submitOrder() function in response to the user clicking this input button using the 
following approaches: as a HTML attribute, as an object property entered as an event handler, 
and as an event listener (during the bubbling phase).
As an HTML attribute:
html
<input type="button" value="Submit" id="SubmitButton" onclick="submitOrder()" />
As an object property:
javascript
document.getElementById('SubmitButton').onclick = submitOrder;
As an event listener (bubbling phase):
javascript
document.getElementById('SubmitButton').addEventListener('click', submitOrder);

1. What is the difference between block scope and function scope?
Block scope (with let and const): Variables are only accessible within the block {} they are declared in.
Function scope (with var): Variables are accessible throughout the entire function, even if declared inside a block.



2. What is the scope of variables declared with the let keyword?
Variables declared with let have block scope, meaning they are only accessible within the block they are defined in.



3. What are the possible values for a Boolean variable?
The possible values are true and false.



4. What is the difference between a strongly typed and a loosely typed language? Which is JavaScript?
Strongly typed: Variable types are fixed and strictly enforced (e.g., Java).
Loosely typed: Variable types can change dynamically (e.g., JavaScript).
JavaScript is loosely typed.

1. What is the difference between a binary operator and a unary operator?
A binary operator works with two operands (e.g., a + b).
A unary operator works with one operand (e.g., ++a).



2. How does JavaScript deal with code that performs arithmetic operations on string values?
JavaScript tries to convert string values to numbers for arithmetic operations. If conversion fails, 
it results in NaN (Not a Number).



3. What is a comparison operator? What kind of value does it return?
Comparison operator:

A comparison operator compares two values (e.g., ==, ===, <, >). It returns a Boolean value, either true or false.


4. What is a falsy value? What are the six falsy values in JavaScript?
Falsy values in JavaScript:
A falsy value is treated as false in a Boolean context.
The six falsy values are:
false
0
"" (empty string)
null
undefined
NaN (Not a Number)
