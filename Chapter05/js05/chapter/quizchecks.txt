Quick Check 1
1. Provide the code to reference the last child element of the element with the id “main”.
document.getElementById("main").lastElementChild

2. What properties would you combine to reference the “cousin” of a node (where cousin refers to the first child of the previous sibling of the parent of node)?
node.parentNode.previousSibling.firstChild

3. Provide code to create a span element node named rating belonging to the “review” class.
let rating = document.createElement("span");
rating.className = "review";

4. Provide code to append the rating element node to a div element with the id “reviews”.
document.getElementById("reviews").appendChild(rating);

5. Provide code to change the font size of the rating element to 1.2em.
rating.style.fontsize = "1.2em";



Quick Check 2
1. Where does the appendChild() method place nodes?
The nodes are always placed after the last child node of the parent node.

2. Provide code to create a copy of the rating node, including all the node’s descendants.
rating.cloneNode(true);

3. Provide code to repeat the checkAnswers() function every 10 seconds; store the time id in the variable timeID.
timeID = window.setInterval(checkAnswers, 10000);

4. Provide code to stop the checkAnswers() function from repeating.
clearInterval(timeID);
