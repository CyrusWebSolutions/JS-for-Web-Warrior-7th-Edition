Quick Check 1

1. Show how to create an array named foodMenu containing the text strings “Breakfast”, “Lunch”, and “Dinner” as an array 
literal and using the new Array() object constructor.
Using an Array Literal:


let foodMenu = ["Breakfast", "Lunch", "Dinner"];
Explanation: This syntax uses square brackets [] to define an array and directly places the values within it. This is known 
as an array literal.

Using the new Array() Constructor:

let foodMenu = new Array("Breakfast", "Lunch", "Dinner");
Explanation: Here, the new Array() constructor is used to create an array and initialize it with values passed as arguments. 
Each string becomes an element in the foodMenu array.


2. Provide a command to return the size of the array customerOrders.
customerOrders.length;

3. Provide a command to return the tenth entry in the customerOrders array.
customerOrders[9];

4. Provide the expression to reference to fifth inline image in the document.
let img = document.getElementsByTagName("img");
img[4];

Explanation: document.getElementsByTagName("img") returns a collection of all <img> elements in the document, just like 
document.images. By accessing img[4], you’re referencing the fifth image (since the collection is zero-indexed). This 
approach is functionally equivalent to document.images[4].

5. Provide the expression to reference the third element belonging to the blogpost class.
document.getElementsByClassName("blogpost")[2];
Explanation: document.getElementsByClassName("blogpost") retrieves a collection of all elements with the class name blogpost. 
Since this collection is zero-indexed, accessing [2] will give you the third element in the collection.

Quick Check 2
1. Show how to use a while loop to write the HTML code <td>counter</td> for integer values of counter ranging from 1 to 100 by 1.
let i = 1;

while (i <= 100) {
  document.write("<td> " + i + " </td>");
  i++;
}


2. What is the most important difference between a while loop and a do while loop?
The do while loop is evaluated after the command block has been executed at least once.


3. Provide code for a for loop that writes the following HTML code:
<td>3</td> <td>6</td> <td>12</td> <td>24</td> <td>48</td> <td>96</td>

function question2() {
  let i = 1;

  while (i <= 100) {
    document.write("<td> " + i + " </td>");
    i++;
  }
}
function question3() {
  document.write("<br>");
  
  for (let i = 3; i <= 96; i *= 2 ) {
    document.write("<td> " + i + " </td>");
  }
}

question2();
question3();

4. What JavaScript method can be used to insert HTML code just after an element’s opening tag?
document.insertAdjacentHTML("afterBegin", text);

5. What JavaScript method can be used to apply a function to each element of an array without writing a program loop?
forEach()


Quick Check 3
1. Provide the code for an if statement that displays an alert window with the message "You passed with an A" if the 
value of the exam variable is greater than 90.
function question() {
  document.write("<br>");
  let exam = 91;
  if (exam >= 90) {
    window.alert("You passed with an A");
  }
}

2. Provide the code for an if else statement that displays an alert window with the message "You passed with an A" if 
the value of the exam variable is greater than 90 and the message "Not an A" if otherwise.
function question() {
  document.write("<br>");
  let exam = 89;
  if (exam >= 90) {
    window.alert("You passed with an A");
  } else if (exam < 90) {
    window.alert("Not an A");
  } else {
    window.alert("Error");
  }
  
}

3. Provide the code for an else if statement that displays the message "You passed with an A" if exam is greater than 
90, else if exam is greater than 80 the browser displays the message "You passed with a B". else if exam is greater than 
70, the message "You passed with an C" is displayed, else the message "You did not pass" is displayed.
function question() {
  document.write("<br>");
  let exam = 69;
  if (exam >= 90) {
    window.alert("You passed with an A");
  } else if (exam >= 80) {
    window.alert("You passed with a B");
  } else if (exam >= 70) {
    window.alert("You passed with a C");
  } else if (exam >= 60) {
    window.alert("You did not pass");
  }
}

4. Provide the general code for a browser test that tests whether or not the browser supports the findIndex() method when 
applied to an array named xValues.

if (xValues.findIndex) {
    // Statements using the findIndex() method
} else {
    // Statements using an alternate solution
}

5. How should you write the code for a switch statement to allow more than one condition to be run by the JavaScript interpreter?
Omit the break command from the different case statements.
