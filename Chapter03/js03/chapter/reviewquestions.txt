1.What is the correct syntax for creating an empty array named taxRules?

Options:
A. let taxRules = {};
B. let taxRules;
C. let taxRules = [];
D. let taxRules[5];
Answer: C. let taxRules = [];

Explanation: The square brackets [] are the correct syntax for creating an empty array in JavaScript, 
signifying an empty array rather than an empty object ({}).

2. Which of the following statements adds the value “oak” as the third element of the trees array?

Options:
A. trees += "oak";
B. trees += "","","oak";
C. trees[2] = "oak";
D. trees[3] = "oak";
Answer: C. trees[2] = "oak";

Explanation: Arrays are zero-indexed, so to add "oak" as the third element, we assign it to index 2.

3. Which of the following properties returns the number of elements in an array?

Options:
A. length
B. size
C. elements
D. indexes
Answer: A. length

Explanation: The length property returns the number of elements in an array in JavaScript.

4. To create a multidimensional array in JavaScript, you must ________.

Options:
A. use the new Matrix() object constructor
B. nest one array within another
C. load a JavaScript library with special array tools
D. apply the forEach() array method
Answer: B. nest one array within another

Explanation: JavaScript multidimensional arrays are made by nesting arrays within arrays to create rows and columns.

5. To reference the element in the third row and fourth column of the multidimensional array xValues, use:

Options:
A. xValues(3, 4)
B. xValues[3, 4]
C. xValues[2][3]
D. xValues[2, 3]
Answer: C. xValues[2][3]

Explanation: JavaScript arrays are zero-indexed, so the third row is index 2, and the fourth column is index 3.

6. To reference the third inline image found within the web page document, use:

Options:
A. document.images.3
B. document.images[3]
C. image.2
D. document.images[2]
Answer: B. document.images[3]

Explanation: document.images is an array-like collection of images where the third image is at index 2.

7. If you do not include code that changes the counter value in a loop statement, your program will be caught in a(n) ________.

Options:
A. iteration
B. condition
C. fallthrough
D. infinite loop
Answer: D. infinite loop

Explanation: Without a changing counter, the loop never meets its stopping condition, leading to an infinite loop.

8. To access HTML elements by the value of their class attribute, which of the following would you use?

Options:
A. document.getElementsByClassName()
B. document.getElementByClassName()
C. document.getElementsByClass()
D. document.getClasses()
Answer: A. document.getElementsByClassName()

Explanation: document.getElementsByClassName() is used to retrieve all elements with a specified class name.

9. Each repetition of a program loop is called a(n) ________.

Options:
A. command block
B. counter
C. iteration
D. while loop
Answer: C. iteration

Explanation: Each cycle of code execution within a loop is termed an iteration.

10. Posttest loops are ________.

Options:
A. program loops in which the stopping condition is evaluated before each iteration of the command block
B. program loops in which the stopping condition is evaluated after the command block has been executed at least once
C. used in while loops and for loops
D. loops that have no stopping condition
Answer: B. program loops in which the stopping condition is evaluated after the command block has been executed at least once

Explanation: A posttest loop executes the loop body at least once before evaluating the stopping condition.

11. Which of the following can be used as part of a for loop to go through all the elements in the xValues array?

Options:
A. for (let i = 1; i < xValues.length; i++)
B. for (let i = 0; i <= xValues.length; i++)
C. for (let i = 0; i < xValues.length; i++)
D. for (let i = 1; i = xValues.length; i++)
Answer: C. for (let i = 0; i < xValues.length; i++)

Explanation: Option C correctly iterates over all elements by starting at index 0 and using < to stop before reaching xValues.length.

12. A simple if else statement enables you to specify code for ________ alternatives.

Options:
A. 2
B. 3
C. 4
D. unlimited
Answer: A. 2

Explanation: A simple if else statement allows two alternatives: one for if and one for else.

13. To insert HTML code within an element without overwriting code already in that element, use the ________ method.

Options:
A. innerHTML()
B. insertAdjacentHTML()
C. document.write()
D. insertHTML()
Answer: B. insertAdjacentHTML()

Explanation: insertAdjacentHTML() adds HTML without overwriting existing content, whereas innerHTML would replace it.

14. The forEach() method ________.

Options:
A. requires a JavaScript extension
B. is an example of a pretest loop
C. is an example of a posttest loop
D. is used to apply a function to every element within an array without using a program loop
Answer: D. is used to apply a function to every element within an array without using a program loop

Explanation: The forEach() method applies a function to each element of an array, serving as a built-in array iterator.

15. In an if else statement, the else command block will run when ________.

Options:
A. the conditional expression is true
B. the conditional expression is false
C. the conditional expression is undefined
D. the conditional expression is falsy
Answer: B. the conditional expression is false

Explanation: The else block runs only when the if condition evaluates as false.

16. Describe two ways of declaring a JavaScript array.

Answer: let arr = []; or let arr = new Array();

Explanation: An array in JavaScript can be declared with square brackets for an empty array or with the Array constructor 
for an array object.

17. Provide the code to reference the fourth element in the projectTeam array.

Answer: projectTeam[3]

Explanation: Since arrays are zero-indexed, the fourth element is at index 3.

18. Provide the code to reference the third div element within a web document.

Answer: document.getElementsByTagName("div")[2]

Explanation: getElementsByTagName("div") returns a collection of all div elements, with the third at index 2.

19. Provide the general code of a for loop that loops through all the div elements within a web document.

Answer:

for (let i = 0; i < document.getElementsByTagName("div").length; i++) {
    // Code to execute for each div element
}
Explanation: This loop iterates over all div elements using their length for the stopping condition.

20. Provide code to insert the HTML text string <h1>Main Heading</h1> directly after the opening tag of the div element 
with the id "Main".

Answer: document.getElementById("Main").insertAdjacentHTML("afterbegin", "<h1>Main Heading</h1>");

Explanation: insertAdjacentHTML("afterbegin", ...) inserts the specified HTML directly after the opening 
tag of the target element.
